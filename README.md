## Project
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, students have to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
In **Stage One**, students will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker should also be added.

## Dependencies
