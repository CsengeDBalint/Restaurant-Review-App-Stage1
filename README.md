## Project

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, students have to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
In **Stage One** students will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker should also be added.

## Dependencies

1. Fork or download the project's repository.

2. Navigate your terminal into the new directory and start a local server.
   e.g.:  Python with the command (Python2) `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` - if port 8000 is already in use than choose another one.                                   (Python 3.x) `python3 -m http.server 8000`
  You can download the current version on the [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
